# Mazraa is a founding digital capacity farm and cooperative on the ThreeFold Grid.

## Mission

To support the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid; a responsible internet backed by neutral, energy efficient and decentralised internet capacity that empowers humanity with a responsible internet platform that is affordable and accessable to all.

## About 
Mazraa is a founding farm and cooperative on the ThreeFold Grid. 
Mazraa supports ThreeFold Foundation's mission to create a Responsible Internet for All, one that is accessible, affordable and energy efficient. We are the first founding farmer on the network and also contribute to ThreeFold's global adoption by hosting development capacity for ThreeFold Tech developers, supporting the promotion and growth of the global community through contributed marketing resources and funding. We believe it's time for the internet to have a major upgrade for the people and our planet.

## Data Capacity
Mazraa's capacity pool was launch on March 2017 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and was officially the first active internet capacity farmer on the network.  In the early first quarter of 2019, developers will be able to access Mazraa's data center capacity to host decentralized application development. We believe that with support from global capacity farmers, developers, and the community, we will collaboratively build a responsible internet and digital economy for all.

## ThreeFold Technology
ThreeFold technology enables a decentralized, blockchain powered edge cloud which is 100% democratized. It's based on open source software that creates neutral, energy efficient and private capacity that's 100% autonomously managed and self-healing. The three technology components are ZERO-OS a simple and efficient operating system, ZERO-ROBOT which autonomously manages the Zero-OS Grid to deliver a self-healing endlessly scalable internet infrastructure. ZERO-CHAIN a blockchain technology that can be used to create any responsible digital medium of exchange which is green, faster, cost-effective and scalable. We use it to create a responsible internet for all.
